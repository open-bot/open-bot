# Rules

A rule is a pair of `filters` and `actions`.

Example (complete configuration file):

``` yaml
bot: my-bot
rules:
- filters:
    commit: true
  actions:
    comment: Thanks for the commit.
```

This rule adds a comment to a pull request when anyone adds a commit to it.

## Filters

## Actions

### close

``` yaml
close: true
```

Closes the issue/PR.

### reopen

``` yaml
reopen: true
```

### label

``` yaml

```

``` yaml
comment:
  message: Hello @{{issue.user.login}}!
  identifier: comment-label
  invasive: true
  edit: true
```

Adds a comment.

If `identifier` is provided it removes an old comment with the same identifier.

If `invasive` is set it resent the comment even if the body is equal.

`invasive` defaults to `false` if `identifier` is set and to `true` otherwise.

If `edit` is `true` it will edit the old comment instead will the new message.

If `message` is empty or undefined it will not add a new comment. It may remove an old comment if `identifer` is set.

### status

``` yaml
status:
  description: "{{comment.body}}" # message
  target_url: "{{comment.html_url}}" # link
  context: status-label # the context of the PR status
  state: pending # one of success, failure, error, pending
```

### merge

``` yaml

  merge_method: merge # one of merge, squash, rebase
```

### set

``` yaml
set:
  id: SOME_VARIABLE_NAME
  value: "{{comment.body}}"
```

Sets a variable name to some value. This variable is also available in rules followed by this rule. Best read this variable with the `ensure` filter.

### schedule

``` yaml
schedule: 2d # 2 days
```

Schedule another rules check in the specified timespan. The lowest schedule wins and overwrite any longer schedule.

## Range

Some expressions accept ranges. Example:

``` text
< 10 > 5, 15-20
```

Means: (smaller than 10 and bigger than 5) or between 15 and 20 (inclusive)

``` js
// in javascript
(x < 10 && x > 5) || (x >= 5 && x <= 20)
```

## Interpolation

Handlebars.js is used to interpolate values.

### Context

`owner`: repo owner

`repo`: repo name

`item`: full issue name `open-bot/open-bot#1`

`botUsername`: the username of the bot

`data`: data provided by filters

`issue`: github api issue data

others: keys provided by the filters

Example:

``` yaml
- filters:
    comment_1: Hello
    comment_2: World
  actions:
    comment: |-
      Hello World provided by @{{comment_1.actor.login}} and @{{comment_2.actor.login}}.
```

Note: every filter/action key can be suffixed with `_(number)` to make them unique.

Note: you can add a `id` property to assign the value to some other name.

Note: See github api documentation for full object details.

### Helpers

`{{quote comment.body}}`: Wraps value in `>` to make it a markdown quote.

`{{stringify comment}}`: JSON.stringify the value.

## Examples

``` yaml
- filters: # Look for a comment
    comment: Hello
  actions: # Post a new comment
    comment: Hello @{{comment.actor.login}}.
```

Respond to any comment containing "Hello" with a comment "Hello @user.".

``` yaml
- filters:
    open: true
    status: # Look for the latest travis results
      context: "continuous-integration/travis-ci/pr"
    ensure: # Check travis state
      value: "{{status.state}}"
      equals: "success"
  actions:
    label: # relabel
      add: "ci-ok"
      remove: "ci-not-ok"
    comment: # post comment
      identifier: "ci-result"
      edit: true
      message: |-

    ensure:
      value: "{{status.state}}"
      equals: "failure"

        Failed. @{{issue.user.login}} Check [CI results]({{status.target_url}})!
```

Label pull request with `ci-ok` or `ci-not-ok` depending on the CI result. Also comment on the pull request to trigger the user.

``` yaml
- filters:
    open: true
    threshold:
      maximum: 1

        issue_1: Type
        issue_2: Expected
        issue_3: Current
  actions:
    label: missing-information
    close: true
    comment: Closed because information is missing. Edit the issue!
- filters:
    open: false
    label: missing-information
    threshold:
      minimum: 2
      filters:
        issue_1: Type
        issue_2: Expected
        issue_3: Current
  actions:
    label:
      remove: missing-information
    reopen: true
